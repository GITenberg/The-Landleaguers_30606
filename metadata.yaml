description: The Landleaguers, Trollope's last novel, is set in Ireland during the
  Land War of the early 1880s. It is both a documentary record, closely following
  events in Westminster and the Irish countryside, and a meditative fantasy. A landlord's
  son is murdered by rural terrorists, a crime that replays the real-life assassination
  of Lord Frederic Cavendish in Dublin in 1882, and the novel traces the violent disruption
  of civil life as tenants, organized in the Land League, plot to force their landlords
  to give them a better deal. But part of Trollope's imaginative response to the crisis
  takes the form of an intriguingly uncharacteristic sub-plot, in which a young American
  woman travels to London and tries to make a name for herself on the operatic stage,
  while her father becomes a landleaguing Member of Parliament.
